[[https://cirrus-ci.com/github/casm-lang/libstdhl][https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/casm-lang/libstdhl.svg]]
[[https://codecov.io/gh/casm-lang/libstdhl][https://codecov.io/gh/casm-lang/libstdhl/badge.svg]]

This library includes some basic data-structures, classes, definitions etc.
which are used in several projects for different languages.

Currently the repository covers some Python and C/C++ libraries.

This repository is still in a early stage and more libraries and documentation
is coming soon!
